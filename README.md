# IEME4200 Human Centered Design & Innovation (Fall 2022)
Welcome to my Github repo for IEME 4200! The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to human-centered design, theory, and practices, as well as hands-on experience creating a product. Each week's class will include a lecture/theory segment (Tuesday) and a lab on Thursday where we work on exercises to apply theory to practice.
